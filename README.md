# 🔐 AI Cybersecurity Threat Detector

This project uses machine learning to detect malicious network traffic using the [CICIDS2017 dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html). It's a beginner-friendly implementation using Python, pandas, and a Random Forest classifier.

## 🧠 Features

- Detects malicious vs normal traffic
- Based on open-source network security dataset
- Beginner-friendly ML implementation
- Easily extendable to deep learning or real-time use
